1. Using "-mkdir" a directory is created in the Hadoop File System.
          hdfs dfs -mkdir /hadoop_files/

2.Using the command " -copyFromLocal" both the files are uploaded to HDFS:
         hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal /home/cloudera/ICP1/shakespeare.txt  /hadoop_files/
         hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal /home/cloudera/ICP1/word_list.txt /hadoop_files/

3.Using the "-cat" command, add both the files:
	hdfs dfs -cat /hadoop_files/shakespeare.txt /hadoop_files/word_list.txt
               | 

4.Using "-put" command, put into the HDFS files:
hdfs dfs -put -  /hadoop_files/ICP1_output.txt
